# Description

Hayley has a problem making decisions (Thats not a dig its just a personality trait.) 

Her very own app will resolve these issues especially when it comes to deciding what she's eating.


# Prelim thoughts

App only - no web browser/desktop access. 

Preferably no backend - no need to store any user data 

Focus on polished design and deployment of an app to app store. 

React native for build - expand on react skills.
